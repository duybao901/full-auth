                <h2>Rolling In The Deep</h2>
                    There's a fire starting in my heart<br />
                    Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark<br />
                    Finally I can see you crystal clear<br />
                    Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare.<br />
                <br />
                    See how I'll leave, with every piece of you<br />
                    Don't underestimate the things that I will do<br />
                    There's a fire starting in my heart<br />
                    Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark.<br />
                <br />
                    The scars of your love, remind me of us<br />
                    They keep me thinking that we almost had it all<br />
                    The scars of your love, they leave me breathless<br />
                    I can't feeling.<br />
                <br />
                    We could of had it all<br />
                    Rolling in the deep<br />
                    You had my heart inside your hand<br />
                    And you played it to the beat<br />
                <br />
                    Baby I have no story to be told<br />
                    But I've heard one of you and I'm gonna make your head burn<br />
                    Think of me in the depths of your despair<br />
                    Making a home down there as mine sure won't be shared.<br />
                <br />
                    The scars of your love, remind you of us  <br />
                    They keep me thinking that we almost had it all  <br />
                    The scars of your love, they leave me breathless  <br />
                    I can't feeling.  <br />
                <br />
                    Throw your soul threw every open door <br />
                    Count your blessings to find what you look for <br />
                    Turn my sorrow into treasured gold <br />
                    You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow. <br />
                <br />
                    I wish you never gonna miss you <br />
                    We could of had it all <br />
                    We could of had it all <br />
                    I wish you never gonna miss you <br />
                    It all. <br />
